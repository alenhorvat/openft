# OpeNFT Smart contract

TODO: update the description and use of the SC.

IMPORTANT: This is a draft SC and is not security audited. Do NOT use the SC for any production!

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
